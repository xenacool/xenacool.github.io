mod common;
//! A track editor: a closed loop of control points that the pointer pulls into shape, a road
//! swept along it, and land under it that the pointer raises into hills.
//!
//! The track is a `TrackDesign`, a closed loop through control points that each carry a height
//! and a road width. The road is a node of the view, swept along the design by `bevy_gradmesh`,
//! and the `world` module draws the land and the light around it; the editor adds what is
//! needed to edit the track: a gem on every control point, a width handle, a hills brush and a
//! radial menu. It is built on the same library pieces as the cozy castle: [`hud`](bevy_composable_dragging::hud),
//! [`radial`](bevy_composable_dragging::radial) and
//! [`handles`](bevy_composable_dragging::handles), with the land as a
//! [`heightmap`](bevy_composable_dragging::heightmap).
//!
//! - Move: pull a gem and the control point follows the pointer, which bends the curve of the
//!   road through it. Pressing a gem selects its control point.
//! - The hub, which rests in the corner of the screen, pops up over the selected point; press it
//!   for the ring of tools and choose Move, Width or Hills.
//! - Width: the handle at the edge of the road widens it when you pull it out and narrows it when
//!   you push it in.
//! - The land under the road is its own heightmap, not the road. Hills takes hold of the land
//!   where you press it and raises it when you drag up and lowers it when you drag down, in a
//!   round patch; a column shows the patch while you hold the press. The land never covers the
//!   road: it is cut down along the road, whether the hill or the road moved last, and a control
//!   point cannot be pulled off the map.
//! - The view is an architect's map in orthographic projection at 45 degrees from a corner, with
//!   a grid on the ground and a stilt from the ground to every control point. It shows the whole
//!   map at any shape of window. Pressing the land selects nothing.
//!
//! Run with `cargo run --example kart_racer_editor --features shapes-3d`. With `DSD_SCREENSHOT`
//! set it plays a scripted tour of all of this and records it.
